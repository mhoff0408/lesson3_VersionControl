            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later (GitHub, 2013). VCS are a vital part of today’s file sharing/hosting/editing within companies and different varieties of workplaces. The VCS assists in saving previous forms of a file without overwriting said file. In addition, the VCS allows the user to see who editied the file, when it was editied, what changes were made within the file, and, if needed, to revert back to older versions of the file in order to find a mistake that has been made or access a previous version in order to compare the progression over time of the state of the file. There are local, distributed, and centralized forms of VCS.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is unlike any other type of VCS. Most version control software thinks of itself as a large library of files that store file changes over time and through multiple users. Git can be thought of as a storage of “snapshots” of a file. Instead of recording the changes that each different file save has, Git instead takes a “snapshot” of the files as they are, and then saves a link to a file that has already been saved. This avoids saving multiples of one file or overwriting a file, as well as speeds up processing time and accessibility for the user.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To start off, a repository must be made in order for the user to being working on version-controlling existing files. The init command will initiate this action and create a skeleton in which your repository will store the files. Next, the user must use the “add” command in order to select which files to import into the VCS as well as distinguish what the files are by giving them a pseudonym. The “commit” command is used to define the repository and files in a way that is useful and distinguishable to the end user. These are the first steps in beginning work on a Version controlled server.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are some simple command lines that every user should acquaint themselves with in order to begin using a VCS, or more specifically, Git. “Init” will start a repository in which the user can begin working and storing files on the shared server. “Add” will allow a user to add files which they want to work with or edit within the repository. “Commit” will define the added files in a way convenient for the user. “Log” will show all the backups saved in the repository. “Status” will show all the changes that have been made to files and which are added to the staging area. “Blame” is pretty interesting because it allows a user to see who edited or wrote a specific line of code. And last, but not least, is “diff”, which allows a user to see all the differences between the current files and the back ups in the repository.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to use Git, one must first set up an account with the openly free software service. This can all be done using just an email address and setting up a username and account associated with that address. Very Important: Make sure that you check your email to verify the account after it is created; if this is not done, projects cannot be recalled later to work on. In order to link this with a project, say in Cloud9, the SSH key must be put within your account. After navigating through the cloud9 dashboard and finding said SSH key, the user is able to paste that into their account settings within Git, and from there we have a working account setup. All that is left now is to add the files and create a repository for which to work in.
